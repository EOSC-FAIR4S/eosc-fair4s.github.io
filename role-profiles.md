Each role profile identifies three or four key skills for the role and, for each answers the following questions:

1. Why is this a key skill for this role?
2. What level of expertise is expected?
3. Who may help?
4. Where can you learn?

In the following, role profiles are given for each of the following professional groups except those indicated with *, which we propose subsequent EOSC projects should further define.
