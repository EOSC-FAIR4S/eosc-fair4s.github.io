title: Introduction to Python
description: |-
  The course targets beginning Python developers and people familiar with scripting. The basics required to complete the course are covered, but ideally you already feel comfortable writing small scripts in any language. We highly recommend to use your own laptop (Linux, MacOS, Cygwin) for the exercises.
