title: Productive GPU Programming with OpenACC
description: |-
  OpenACC is a directive-based programming model for highly parallel systems, which allows for automated generation of portable GPU code. In this tutorial, we will get to know the programming model with examples, learn how to use the associated tools environment, and incorporate first strategies for performance optimization into our programs. Finally, we will integrate OpenACC with other GPU programming strategies.
