title: BabelNet Extractor Tutorial
description: | 
  The objective of this component is to scan a tokenized text to detect entries in BabelNet in the input document. This component is the base of entity linking and word sense disambiguation as it detects the candidates to be disambiguated. The component produces WSD item annotations as defined in the DKPro WSD typesystem. Afterwards, disambiguation can be performed by other components (like DKPro WSD). The component has been shared as a Docker and the code released in Github with a GPL license.
