title: Integrating Open Science in Information Literacy education
description: | 
  This course describes the integration of Open Science topics in a newly developed Information Literacy workshop for 1st-year PhD candidates. The workshop treats Open Science as an integral part of Information Literacy and does not set it apart. Awareness of Open Science topics is an important step in the development of PhD candidates into “informed researchers”.

  Learning objectives
  * Understand the reasons for and against integrating Open Science topics into existing Information Literacy courses.
  * Identify how Open Science topics are integrated into a new workshop for PhD candidates about Information and Data in general.
