title: Parallel programming with OpenMP and MPI
description: |-
  OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is a programming interface for shared memory parallelization on multiprocessor computers.
  The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a comunication standard describing the exchange of messages for distributed memory parallelization on parallel computers.
  Both programming concepts will be introduced with simple examples.
  In this course, you will learn to write simple parallel programs using both interfaces.

  Since this course is conducted on Linux systems, you should be able to use the command line and have some basic programming skills in C/C++.
