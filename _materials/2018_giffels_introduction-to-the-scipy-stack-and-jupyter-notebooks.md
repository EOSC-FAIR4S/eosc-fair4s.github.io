title: Introduction to the SciPy stack and Jupyter Notebooks
description: |-
  Python provides a rich ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamental packages of the SciPy stack.
  You will learn how-to: perform fast numerical calculations in N dimensions using NumPy, analyze your data using Pandas, and visualize the results using Matplotlib. The exercises will be performed in the Jupyter Notebook environment, which you can access through your web browser.
  You will need a tablet or a laptop and basic knowledge of the Python programming language.
