title: How to get your article published
description: | 
  ### Aims and working method
  
  The aim of this course is to provide you with the tools to write a publishable article and to submit the best product possible.

  The course will address critical information and participants' questions regarding successful publishing. In this four-day course PhD candidates will be introduced to the requirements of different types of academic publishing: 1) the relevance of bibliometric measures and impact scores; 2) identify journals that are possibly relevant outlets, and; 3) develop a publication strategy for their own PhD trajectory.

  The course will also offer more insight into the major reasons for rejection and ways to enhance the chances of success. Participants are requested to bring an example of their own writing and will work under guidance of a senior researcher to turn their work into a journal submission.

  ### Learning objectives

  After course completion participants will have:

  * a better understanding on the process of writing and submitting their article, resulting in an acceleration of the writing process, and of the chance to get accepted;
  * insight into essential characteristics and the do’s and dont’s, resulting in a higher quality of their article and a higher chance of getting accepted;
  * a directly submittable form of one of their own articles.
