title: Introduction to Go
description: |-
  In this workshop, we will introduce the basics of programming in Go and then work our way up to concurrency programming with this relatively new language.

  We'll start with the usual "Hello World" program, introduce functions, variables, packages and then interfaces.
  Then, we will tackle the two main tools at the disposal of the Go programmer (colloquially known as a gopher): the channels and the goroutines.
  This will be done by implementing a small peer to peer application transmitting text messages over the network.

  The workshop wraps up with a whirlwind tour of scientific and non-scientific libraries readily available, and prospects/news about the next Go version.
