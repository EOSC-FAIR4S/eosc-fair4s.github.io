      You have in-depth understanding of your organisation's RDM policy, and of the policies of relevant research funders in relation to planning for FAIR outputs, including Data Management Plans. You have in-depth knowledge of  the legal and ethical frameworks applicable to the research communities you support. You are also familiar with these communities’ research methods, tools, standards and services used locally.   You are able to translate this knowledge and understanding into expert advice for researchers at all career stages on what should be covered in the Data Management Plan (DMP).  You can articulate how planning benefits the researcher as the ‘first reuser’ of their outputs, and seek help where needed from other professional services.

      Code / software supporting your research analyses or underlying the  results are made as open as possible, as closed as necessary. Whether or not you need to develop software, or write scripts to analyse your data, you can describe the opportunities that electronic lab notebooks, virtual research environments and other online services should offer your research. And if you do develop code or software scripts you can show you understand how to get credit for the contributions the software makes to published results.

    description: |-
      You can identify examples of data and code that offer insights to advance research fields you support, and describe the importance of these being FAIR. You advise researchers on infrastructures, identifiers and metadata standards they can use to provide a traceable path of documentation from creation to analysis. You provide expert advice on making data findable, identifying relevant infrastructures, persistent identifiers and metadata standards to ensure accessibility of (meta)data to potential (re)users. Your also advise on the interoperability of data, including broadly applicable languages, vocabularies and other standards; and on documentation and licensing to aid reusability

      Based on your insight into how current and emerging infrastructure and tools may support implementation of RDM policies in the research areas you support, you formulate a strategy or roadmap for implementing FAIR principles through participation in relevant committees and working groups. Your advise on the development of standard solutions for recurring RDM issues and monitor the availability of support. With extensive knowledge of relevant skills and the resources available to develop skills, you initiate and support training and recruitment of colleagues in professional services to support data management.
