      Many funding bodies expect research projects to start with a plan of how the outputs will be made FAIR for future use. Some expectations may also apply to PhD projects. You should understand why funders have these expectations, why scientific organisations and research institutions support them, and what should be covered in the Data Management Plan (DMP) . The planning should include databases, software code, and physical samples where appropriate. It is important to understand how planning benefits yourself as the ‘first reuser’ of your outputs. Get advice from a research supervisor, and from your institution.

    description: |-
      From the beginning of your career you need to know the regulations, ethical principles, and community expectations affecting research, and how to apply them. Responsibilities will apply to you, your colleagues, your organisation, and to any service providers used. Making research data and code FAIR helps meet your responsibility to be able to base published claims on evidence, and share that evidence. If the research involves public concerns, risks to individuals, or impacts on society you also have an ethical responsibility to engage with representatives of those affected. You should be confident discussing with senior colleagues how you have not only complied with relevant requirements but conducted the research professionally.

    keyskill: contribution_recognition_citation_and_acknowledgement
    description: |-
      To apply principles of research integrity and professional conduct you need to know how to properly cite any data, code and methods that you reuse. When you publish your thesis or dissertation  you should also acknowledge your collaborators, technicians or others who have contributed to results, as co-authors where appropriate. Use standards to credit those who helped with collection, management, documentation, publication and archiving of research outputs, so that everyone’s expertise is appropriately rewarded. By using standard output identifiers (e.g. DOIs) researcher identifiers (e.g. ORCID) and contributor roles (e.g. the [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) taxonomy) you will also help to make your outputs findable by others.

      You should be aware of the sources of research funding, including opportunities for open science and innovation.  It is important to know what funders in your field typically look for in an application. That will include a realistic budget, to include the costs of making outputs FAIR, as open as possible and as closed as necessary.  This may need specialist advice e.g. on dedicated support staff, on storage costs, or about charges for depositing outputs in a repository. You can also think about applying for dedicated funding to promote open science activities, events, training or other professional development activities. You should be confident discussing research questions and the steps needed to turn ideas into a grant application, with help from a research supervisor, and from your organisation’s professional advisors.
