    description: |-
      From your experience in building collaborative projects and a network of peers you have in-depth understanding of the need for effort to be recognised, cited and acknowledged. Fully aware of research integrity principles and codes of professional research conduct you are able to formulate  guidelines for your research group on their practices for citing data, code and methods that they reuse. The students and early career researchers you supervise know how to acknowledge collaborators, technicians or others who have contributed to results, as co-authors where appropriate. You contribute to establishing standards in your domain for crediting those who helped with collection, management, documentation, publication and archiving of research outputs,  and can offer guidance on applying standard output identifiers (e.g. DOIs) researcher identifiers (e.g. ORCID) and contributor roles (e.g. the [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) taxonomy).

      You draw on your relationship with senior colleagues and encourage them to support you in influencing changes in your research group, including its hiring and promotion decisions. You are able to encourage colleagues and the staff you supervise to adopt practices that will make research outputs as FAIR and open as possible, and to use your influence to ensure they are recognised and rewarded for their efforts in doing so. You contribute to debates in your institution or research field on the application of FAIR principles, research integrity and open science to your context.
