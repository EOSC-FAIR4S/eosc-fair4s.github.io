      Being responsible and accountable for your research group’s activities and behaviour, you have in-depth understanding of the legal, ethical aspects of research, including principles for making research outputs FAIR. You are able to evaluate and manage the opportunities to demonstrate good practice, as well as the risks to individual and institutional reputations that ethical and/or legal infringement would jeopardise. You demonstrate the knowledge and ability to define the responsibilities of staff or students you are responsible for, and communicate effectively with them and with professional support staff able to offer specialist advice.

    description: |-
      From your experience in building your organisation’s research capabilities you fully understand  the need for effort to be recognised, cited and acknowledged. Fully aware of research integrity principles and codes of professional research conduct you are able to apply guidelines for your research group on their practices for citing data, code and methods that they reuse. The students and early career researchers you supervise know how to acknowledge collaborators, technicians or others who have contributed to results, as co-authors where appropriate. You are well informed of standards in your domain for crediting those who helped with collection, management, documentation, publication and archiving of research outputs, and those for identifying research outputs (e.g. DOIs) researcher identifiers (e.g. ORCID) and contributor roles (e.g. the CRediT taxonomy).
