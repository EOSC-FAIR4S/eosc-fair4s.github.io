      Understanding the opportunities that existing sources can offer as raw material for your own research, you can demonstrate the skills to find, access, integrate and reuse data from these sources.  Datasets may come from publicly available repositories in your own domain or from others. They may come from your own network of collaborators, or from others. You seek advice from a data steward, data librarian or archivist where appropriate, to help broaden the opportunities available to you. You also seek their assistance where necessary to make data actionable, whether it is from external sources or within your own team.

    description: |-
      Code / software supporting your research analyses or underlying the  results are made as open as possible, as closed as necessary. Whether or not you need to develop software, or write scripts to analyse your data, you can describe the opportunities that electronic lab notebooks, virtual research environments and other online services should offer your research. And if you do develop code or software scripts you can show you understand how to get credit for the contributions the software makes to published results.

    description: |-
      You can identify examples of data and code that offer insights to advance your field, and understand the importance of these being FAIR. You understand also that the value of data for reuse, and as evidence for published research claims, depends on there being a traceable path of documentation from creation to analysis. You can apply provenance concepts in your community, and use standard formats and identifiers for metadata and data. Using these you help yourself and others to find and get further practical value from research data, making it accessible, and recording  how data is managed  to ensure it is interoperable and reusable in different contexts.

    keyskill: contribution_recognition_citation_and_acknowledgement
    description: |-
      Building on your awareness  of research integrity principles and codes of professional research conduct you show you are able to properly cite any data, code and methods that you reuse. When you publish results you also acknowledge your collaborators, technicians or others who have contributed to results, as co-authors where appropriate. You apply standards to credit those who helped with collection, management, documentation, publication and archiving of research outputs, so that everyoneâ€™s expertise is appropriately rewarded. By using standard output identifiers (e.g. DOIs) researcher identifiers (e.g. ORCID) and contributor roles (e.g. the CRediT taxonomy) you also help to make your outputs findable by others.
