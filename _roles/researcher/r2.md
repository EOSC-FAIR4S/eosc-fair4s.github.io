      Building on your awareness  of research integrity principles and codes of professional research conduct you should be able to properly cite any data, code and methods that you reuse. When you publish results you should also acknowledge your collaborators, technicians or others who have contributed to results, as co-authors where appropriate. Use standards to credit those who helped with collection, management, documentation, publication and archiving of research outputs, so that everyoneâ€™s expertise is appropriately rewarded. By using standard output identifiers (e.g. DOIs) researcher identifiers (e.g. ORCID) and contributor roles (e.g. the [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) taxonomy) you will also help to make your outputs findable by others.
